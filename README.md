This is a testing framework so I don't have to use Jest. I REALLY, REALLY don't want to have to do this, but I'm fed up of trying to get Jest configured properly. I mean, it's a testing framework. Why should it be impossible to get it to do simple things like work with ES6 modules, or run properly in a monorepo, or work with node_modules that are outside the repo? It's a TEST FRAMEWORK! How can it be so complicated?
